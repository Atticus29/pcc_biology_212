### Communication

Check D2L every day for course content. Use your PCC account for email. DO NOT USE D2L email as it does not get forwarded to my PCC inbox. It is PCC policy that we are to use PCC email for electronic communication about schoolwork or other college related business. I plan on checking my email daily. If you send me an important message and you don’t get a reply from me within two school days, please try again. Please note that I won't accept as an excuse that email failed unless you are able to forward the message you sent.

## Course Info

Second part of a three quarter sequence designed for students majoring in biology and the sciences, including pre-medical, pre-dental, chiropractic, pharmacy, and related fields. Topics include inheritance, the genetic code, modern and classical genetics, evolution, diversity, and systematics.

Recommended: High school biology and chemistry within the past seven years.

Prerequisites: BI 211 C or above or instructor approval.
See [Course Content and Outcomes Guide](http://www.pcc.edu/ccog/default.cfm?fa=ccog&subject=BI&course=211) for a complete course content guide.

## Evaluation

BI 212 is a five credit hour course which meets seven hours per week for the quarter – four hours of lecture and three hours of lab. Lecture and lab sections are linked. This means students must register and attend both as listed above. It is fully transferable.

## Instruction Materials

### Required

- Campbell, Neil, and Jane Reece. **Biology** 11th ed. Benjamin/Cummings Publishing, Menlo Park, CA

- Morgan, Judith and Eloise Carter 2011. **Investigating Biology Laboratory Manual**, 9th ed. Benjamin/Cummings Publishing, Menlo Park, CA

- Access to a desktop, laptop, or tablet and the internet, including D2L course pages (the course and many assignments will largely be administered and/or managed via D2L).

#### Socrative

- We will take advantage of a student response system called [Socrative](https://b.socrative.com/login/student/). The Room Name is **FISHER2070**. We will be using this tool to assess your (collective and personal) comprehension of topics in real time in the classroom. I'll be designing questions that I'll ask during lecture and lab and posting them to the room on Socrative. You'll be able to answer these questions from any browser or from the [ios or Android app](https://www.socrative.com/apps.html) downloaded onto your phone or tablet. If you can, please bring such a device to class every day. **If you are unable to do this, please let me know as soon as possible**.

Your responses on Socrative will be counted towards your participation grade. The correctness of your answers will _not_ factor into your participation score.

In anticipation of students occasionally being unable to attend lecture/lab during the designated course hours due to the remote nature of this quarter's course and the likely chaos of our daily lives during the pandemic, I plan on leaving a version of the socrative questions in "open navigation" mode between lecture sessions. Students who miss class time but answer those questions will still receive participation credit.

### Strongly Recommended

- Calendar or day planner (with due dates and notifications set up)
- D2L's [Brightspace Pulse App](https://www.d2l.com/products/pulse/). Find our course at PCC, and set notifications on your smart phone such that you receive notifications when a course announcement is posted.
- Many students have found it very useful to keep a set of colored pencils or pens for various uses during lecture and lab class

### Optional
- _A Photographic Atlas for the Biology Laboratory_ Van de Graaf. 2007. Morton Publishing, Englewood, Colorado.
- Plan to access to other high-quality educational and library resources including those recommended in class and/or posted at D2L.

### Additional details about graded materials
- **Exams**
	- Unless otherwise announced, you will have a class period (1hr 50min) to take each exam. The format of each exam will include a combination of multiple-choice and short answer questions. Because I drop your lowest exam score, no early or make up exams will be given. There are **no exceptions**. Due to the remote nature of the class this quarter, I plan on having the exam start times be flexible, but the exams will be timed, which will minimize the usefulness of resources I cannot prevent you from using in the remote format of the course. In other words, exams are open book/internet, but you will likely run out of time if you have to look up a lot of details.
- **WISHeS**
	- Students rarely have the chance to ruminate on past answers and consider potential mistakes, which is a shame, because it's a great learning tool. Thus, upon completion of the exam, you will have the opportunity to re-take the exam with a partner with open notes and open internet. You will have _one week_ to turn in your "what I should have said" (WISHeS) exam. You won't have access to your original answers until after you've turned in your WISHeS exam. **10% of the difference between your score on this version and your original score will be added to your original score**.
- **Final Exam**
	- Makeup exams for the final exam will be given only under very extenuating circumstances and only upon prompt notification of the instructor. It is likely that a makeup final exam will not be same exam taken by the rest of the class. It may be in long-answer or essay format, to be determined at the discretion of the instructor. It is not to your advantage to take a makeup final exam for trivial reasons, but if you are genuinely too ill to take the exam at the scheduled time, let me know as soon as possible. Keep in mind that grades are due soon after the final exam date, so time will be limited. Due to the remote nature of the class this quarter, I plan on having the exam start times be flexible, but the exams will be timed, which will minimize the usefulness of resources I cannot prevent you from using in the remote format of the course. In other words, exams are open book/internet, but you will likely run out of time if you have to look up a lot of details.
- **IHOP** ("In-class" assignments, homework, online assignments, and participation )
	- Some of these will be small group discussion-based critical thinking assignments, with responses captured on Socrative. Your responses on Socrative will be counted towards your participation grade. The correctness of your answers will _not_ factor into your participation score.

	- In anticipation of students occasionally being unable to attend lecture/lab during the designated course hours due to the remote nature of this quarter's course and the likely chaos of our daily lives during the pandemic, I plan on leaving a version of the socrative questions in "open navigation" mode between lecture sessions. Students who miss class time but answer those questions will still receive participation credit.

	- In the weeks coming up to the exams, you will also be asked to generate practice exams as a class and then take them. The points for these assignments will also be considered IHOP points. **Because of the time-sensitive nature of these practice exams, no late credit can be awarded**. See the [practice exam prompt here](https://github.com/Atticus29/pcc_biology_212/blob/master/practice_exam_prompt.md).
- **Discussions**
	- See additional details [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BZCGXynQiokuKJZb7B4dfp5Mm-pH_LlKVSj_KLo0K48/edit?usp=sharing)

- **Laboratory**

    - Biology 212 is a laboratory science class. Therefore, you cannot pass the class without passing the lab portion. If a student earns less than 60% in the lab, he or she will receive an F for the class regardless of his or her score in lecture. Students who have more than 2 lab absences will receive an F for the class.

	- The laboratory session is the part of class where you learn by direct observation and by asking questions, designing experiments, handling biological and chemical material, and using (in the case of our remote class, computational and virtual) equipment.

	- Note that this course includes undergraduate research that will encourage students to practice science by doing science. This will include, but not be limited to, researching primary literature, designing experiments, making collaborative decisions, using instrumentation, conducting peer review, analyzing data, and writing in a specific scientific style.

    - **Lab Exercises and Participation**: _Reading, studying, and preparing for activities before you come to class is vital for success in the course_, and part of this may involve communication with peers outside of class time. You are expected to perform some of the (virtual) lab work cooperatively with a group. In addition to the written materials, you will also be graded on preparedness, participation, and teamwork with your group. It is very much in your interest to be fully engaged, work at an appropriate pace, and leave only when your work is done. Generally, in the context of a remote class, I will be grading or spot-checking submitted deliverables (items you submit on google forms or on D2L) for each lab. These items will (again, generally) be due a week after the beginning of the lab in order to afford you some flexibility as you work from home.

- **Scientific Research project**
    - Check [the prompt](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ho0XQT03uLdZHwexhuaqTr6zElPeRvAo-kEK5zoNDaM/edit?usp=sharing) (also on D2L) and ask questions as needed to ensure that you understand the requirements.


- **Lab quizzes**
    - There will be a quiz each week. Quizzes will cover the previous lab activities and will _also include questions that refer to the current lab activities_. **The quizzes will be timed, but the start time is flexible (within the 24-hour period of the lab day)**. The best way to earn quiz points is to make sure that you are able to discuss and explain the lab activity’s goals, independent and dependent variables, background, methods used, and results before you leave each lab session. The focus of these quizzes is on **comprehension** rather than memorization, but knowledge of terms and organism names introduced in the lab protocol or handout are also essential.

	- **Read and study each lab activity before you do it**. Use your textbook as a resource if you need additional information to support your study of the lab concepts. The lowest quiz grade will be dropped.

- **Lab Practical**
	- This is a very challenging lab exam where you will be asked to identify specimens and structures, apply your knowledge and answer questions about topics you studied throughout the term. A study guide and a PowerPoint presentation to supplement your lab manual will be posted early on during the term

## Course Schedule

### Lecture

A *living* version of the lecture schedule can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zthLSm1GVVM2TEOyFqgmX5YwQ9CPvjyba1ohwKk0etc/edit?usp=sharing). Please refer to this version for the course.


### Lab

Please note that the order of the labs doesn't necessarily follow the order of their occurrence in the lab manual! In light of the switch to remote format given the COVID-19 pandemic, we will be departing from the lab manual more than is ideal.

## Course Policies

### Attendance

- Lecture
    - For BI 212, a key ingredient to your success will be multiple exposures to course content. If your schedule permits, it makes sense to attend the interactive lecture and lab sessions via Zoom (see Online Rooms tab on D2L). However, I acknowledge that this may not always be possible for you, so I will be trying my hardest to record, process, upload, and post video recordings of the lectures. You are an adult, and if you feel confident in your ability to teach yourself the lecture material, it is still technically possible to be quite successful in the class without attending lecture (although I wouldn't recommend it).

- Lab
    - There will be 9 lab exercises. **If you do not turn in the lab work associated with a given lab by its due date, you will receive a zero for that lab's assignment**.

		- Per departmental policy, students who have more than 2 lab absences (missed lab submissions) will receive an F for the class. If you anticipate missing multiple labs well in advance, please notify me as early as possible so that we can navigate potentially extenuating circumstances this quarter.

### Late Assignments

All homework assignments are due at their designated due dates and times (see D2L or lecture/lab schedule); If you turn materials in late on the date due, even if you are just tardy, they will be marked down up to 10%. Late assignments will be marked down 10% each class day after the due date. **Noted that some assignments, such as practice exam questions** won't be accepted late at all. Late assignments will not be accepted after 1 week past their due date unless there are extenuating circumstances. No late materials will be accepted after the last day of class.

Late assignments will be accepted for full credit under extenuating circumstances, such as when you miss class due to illness. These are considered “excused absences” **if you communicate and explain promptly**. Turning in the assignment a week late and simply saying, "Oh yeah, I was sick last week. *Cough cough*." is not an example of prompt communication and explanation.

### Extra Credit

There will be no extra credit opportunities. This is biology department-wide policy at PCC.

### Regrade Policy
If you wish to dispute a grade, I will consider your request up to one full week after the assignment has been returned to you and you have access to solutions (whichever happens later). Requests for grade adjustments beyond the one-week deadline will not be considered.Re-grade requests for assignments and exams will be handled online. In order for a re-grade to be considered, you must message me the following:1. Which question you want addressed2. What your answer was (exactly!). Photo or physical evidence may be required.3. Detailed justification for point recoveryAny requests that do not include ALL THREE things WILL NOT be reviewed. I use this re-grade policy because sometimes writing about the question helps students realize where the mistake was (this is certainly the case for me when I write about things), and it gives students time to write more diplomatic emails (and me more time to truly consider the request and write diplomatic responses).This means that after-class re-grade ambushes will be met with frowns.

## Additional Logistics

### Course Reminders
**Students must pass BI 212 with a C or above to be admitted into courses for which BI 212 is a prerequisite**.Please be sure to speak with an advisor if you are planning to transfer BI 212 credits to another college or university. In most cases, Principles of Biology courses 211-213 are not equivalent across institutions. It is generally best to take all three at the same place to avoid missing critical knowledge that you will need in your 300 level coursework.

### Academic Courtesy
Please demonstrate respect for fellow students during the class period. Please keep in mind that your classmates may have beliefs and opinions that differ from your own. I expect you to show courtesy towards everyone.

Refrain from talking and other distracting behavior during lecture. This will be especially important in a remote setting; I will establish some guidelines to help alleviate that once we are together in a video session.

As you might imagine, we instructors get a ton of emails containing questions that could easily be answered by looking at this document, the lab and lecture schedules, or referring to announcements made online. **As a courtesy to me, please make sure that these information sources have been checked before you email me with logistical questions**. I reserve the right to reply with, "see syllabus", "see schedules", or "see announcements".

### Photography, video, and audio recording
I will be recording video of the lecture and laboratory sessions and posting them online _unlisted_.
Photographing, video-, or audio-recording a classmate or instructor without their permission is considered a violation of privacy and is not allowed.  
Photographing biological specimens or lab instrumentation is allowed and encouraged in the context of our learning activities.


### Academic Integrity
Students are expected to be honest and ethical in their academic work. Cheating, plagiarism, falsifying, and working with others to cheat are all forms of academic dishonesty. This includes submitting work that is identical (or nearly so, based on the judgment of the instructor) to that of another student, even when completed in the context of “group” work. Various penalties may be imposed and a fair hearing process is in place. Refer to Academic Integrity Policy, which is in the Students’ Rights and Responsibilities Handbook, accessible from the PCC home page under Resources.
[Code of Student Conduct](www.pcc.edu/about/policy/student-rights/student-rights.pdf#code-of-student-conduct)
I am happy to meet with you to discuss this if you have questions or concerns, but please make sure they’re addressed before you begin any work for this class. The Writing Center also provides tutors who can help you with any writing related challenges.

### FERPA
The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA) protects the education records of any student who has ever enrolled at PCC.PCC and I as your instructor are committed to treating every student as a respected member of our community of learners. If you have any concerns or questions, please come see me. If I cannot answer your question, I will help you find answers.

### Sanctuary College
PCC is a sanctuary college. For more information, see [www.pcc.edu/resources/undocumented-students/](www.pcc.edu/resources/undocumented-students/).

### Dropping/Withdrawing and Grade Options
Pay attention to the college deadlines for withdrawing from the course or electing a P/NP or Audit option. You are responsible for learning what the options are, and exercising them within the designated time period. A "W" grade will be granted to the student who has followed established school procedures for properly withdrawing from the course within the specified time limits (consult your PCC Schedule of Classes).You may change to Audit or Pass/No Pass up until the dates specified in the schedule of classes.

### Title IX/Non-Discrimination statement
Portland Community College is committed to creating and fostering a learning and working environment based on open communication and mutual respect. If you believe you have encountered sexual harassment, sexual misconduct, sexual assault, or discrimination based on race, color, religion, age, national origin, veteran status, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability please contact the Office of Equity and Inclusion at (971) 722-5840 or equity.inclusion@pcc.edu.

### Incompletes
A student may receive an I for a course if they miss an essential part of the class for a documented reason acceptable to the instructor (trips out of town for vacation, family reunions, or work are not acceptable reasons). To be eligible for an incomplete, the student must have completed 90% of the course with a grade of C or better. The I grade is not substitution for substandard performance. To receive an I, the student and the instructor must sign a written agreement and submit a copy with the division administrative staff.

### Students with Disabilities
 PCC is committed to supporting all students. If you plan to use academic accommodations for this course, you must meet with the instructor privately and in-person to discuss your needs. Accommodations are not retroactive; they can only after you meet with the instructor and the instructor receives the “Approved Academic Accommodations” letter. To request academic accommodations for a disability, please contact a disability services counselor on any PCC campus. Additional information may be located at [www.pcc.edu/resources/disability](www.pcc.edu/resources/disability).

### Basic Needs Statement
PCC wants you to be successful and have resources that may help. If you face challenges affording food or housing, or if you need access to technology, this will naturally affect your classwork.  Check out these resources: [Student COVID-19 Resources](https://www.pcc.edu/coronavirus/information-for-students/resources/) and [Emergency Funds](www.pcc.edu/enroll/paying-for-college/emergency-funds.html). You can also contact a campus Student Conduct and Retention Coordinator at conductandcare@pcc.edu.

### Tips for success in the course

- Ask questions and respect your classmates' rights to ask questions. Asking questions is a hallmark of good science! Every student should feel comfortable asking questions. Don't give up if you feel you don't know what to ask. Learning how to communicate effectively should be one of your goals in a science class. Everyone gets "stuck" at one time or another. Effectively asking questions to help settle your confusion is a very useful and achievable skill. It also happens to be a trait of a good scientist! At the same time, please respect that there is a very long list of topics that we must get through during the course; if the questions don't pertain directly to the course content, perhaps they are better suited for discussions outside of class. I'll let you know when I think a discussion should be taken "off air".

- Science doesn't come naturally to most people; it is a skill, not a talent. If this is your first or among your first collegiate science course(s), you might be surprised at the amount of **time required to be successful**. Typically for every 1 hour a student is in a classroom lecture, they should be putting in 3 hours of homework on assignments, reading, and study time. This means that you should **carve out about 9 hours a week** to devote to reading, reviewing and completing assignments outside of the time spent with me in the classroom. This can vary for each student depending on how effectively you use your time and how well you comprehend the reading, but it should give you an idea of a typical college course expectation.

- Work hard during lectures. This work does not involve writing, word for word, everything that is said. Consider instead the strategy of taking sketchy notes during class, which frees up limited attention space for listening, participating, and thinking about the topics discussed. Following class, flesh out your notes, adding as much detail as possible. This forces a re-thinking of the discussion, putting the concepts in an order that makes sense to you.

- Make a list of questions as you study your notes and read the textbook. Ask these questions during lecture or lab, or ask another student while you're studying.

- Use the chapter objectives provided as a study guide. These review questions will highlight what is most important to focus on in the text. If any of my objectives for a unit go beyond those mentioned in the textbook, I will make you aware of that.

- Speaking of the chapter objectives, it might not hurt to have those pulled up (or even printed out) during lecture, so that you can write notes directly associating material with its objective(s)

- Form study groups (share contact information with each other during "breakout groups")! Study groups can help everyone, whether you are doing well or are doing poorly. Use your study group to quiz each other and offer short teaching demos to each other on particular topics; you never truly appreciate what you know and don't know until you have to teach it to somebody else.
