# Crowd-generated Practice Exams

## Prompt

In an effort to give you practice answering mutliple-choice questions related to the material on each of the three Exams preceding the final exam, but more importantly to give you practice with the arguably more useful cognitive skill of _writing_ good multiple-choice exam questions, you'll be asked to construct a practice exam as a class and then later take the practice exam individually as a low-stakes IHOP assignment. There will be one crowd-generated practice exam for each exam, and the due dates for the questions and for the actual completed practice exam are in [the schedule](https://github.com/Atticus29/pcc_biology_211/blob/master/README.md).

To receive full credit for each crowd-generated practice exam, each student is asked to add one **multiple-choice** question **from each chapter** covered in the exam to the google doc (on D2L). Questions must stem directly from the learning objectives lists for each chapter. After everybody has completed this step, each student will be asked to then **take the practice exam individually**.

#### Guidelines/checklist for Writing Practice Exam Questions

- [ ] Add your name to the questions that you write (see example question in the google doc)
- [ ] **Do not provide the answers to the questions**. I will do that as I score them.
- [ ] Make sure your questions are mutliple-choice
- [ ] Make sure your questions have 4-5 choices each
- [ ] Make sure you have one question from each chapter to be covered on the real exam
- [ ] Make sure your questions stem directly from the learning objectives lists for each chapter
- [ ] Students who add questions after other students are required to check existing students' questions to **avoid duplicate questions**. **Credit will not be granted to duplicate questions or re-phrased questions**. Note that this means that the earlier you submit your questions, the less work you have to do.
- [ ] If you insert a duplicate question **before** another student's question to create the appearance that you came up with question first, **this will be considered academic dishonesty and you will at minimum receive no credit for the assignment**. Please note that google products are versioned, which means that I can track which edits occur and when, so it will be easy to detect such insertions.
- [ ] If you need some help working with Google Docs, please don't hesitate to contact me (or better yet, ask me during lecture or lab in case it's a common question).

#### Guidelines for Taking Practice Exam

- [ ] For full credit, students are required to answer the final feedback question, highlighting questions that are difficult to answer or otherwise might need my attention.


## Assignment Credit and Due Dates

Question submissions for Crowd-Sourced Practice Exams are worth **TODO points each**, for a total of **TODO points for the question-writing portion** of the assignment. All **questions must be submitted by the due date noted on the [course schedule](TODO)**.

Your personal submission is due the subsequent week by (**see [course schedule](TODO) for exact date**). You are welcome to take the practice exam open-book and open-internet, but **_not open-classmate_.**


## Instructor checklist

### Before

- [x] Provide template questions (~2-3) for students to model (including your name)

### After

- [ ] Add last question, "Last Question: Were there any questions you felt were unfair or worded in a way that was confusing even though you knew the content of the question well? If none, please write, “none”. Please note that difficult and unfair are not synonymous."
- [ ] Assign credit to students based on prompt criteria listed above
- [ ] Copy final product to another doc, format as quiz, and make readable but not writeable. Provide link to students and deadline on D2L.
- [ ] Take the practice exam yourself; identify problematic questions and remove. If egregious enough, deduct points from offending questions.
